My name is *Radosław Skupnik*, I live in *Dębica, Poland*, and I'm a *self-taught* software engineer and a computer enthusiast.

When I started, I had fun with *Turbo Pascal*. I was 12 back then, so my greatest achievement was a RAT application that I used to prank my friend three houses down the road over LAN (yeah, houses on the street were joined in a single LAN back then). Ahh, those were the times...

My main programming language is Java and the reason for that is pure coincidence. Back in ~2005, those pieces of software known as *server emulators* were popular. You know, when there's a great MMORPG game out there, but you're just a kid and have no cash to play that game, but you really, really want to, because *massive multiplayer* man, it was mind-bending back then! So people came up with *server emulators* - they basically spoofed the packet traffic between the actual game client and the actual game server and used that to *recreate* the server (*emulate* it) and use the actual client to connect to a fake server - and there you have it, a *private server*. Massively bugged and missing key features, but at least in an achievable price range.

Those were probably somewhat illegal back then? I'm not sure, but as a kid, I had no idea anyway, so I played on a Polish *private server* of a game called *Lineage II* - the server was called *Allseron*. Didn't take long before I took interest in how the server works over the game itself, at which point I started helping with maitaining it - and learning Java along the way.

Nowadays I work as a DevOps Engineer and I spend my working hours setting up Kubernetes clusters, automating stuff with Terraform and studying the Clouds.

From less important information, I love cats, nature, walks in the forest and gaming - mainly Path of Exile :)
